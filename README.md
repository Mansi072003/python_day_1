# Variables, Statements, and Expression : A Learning task 

## 2.1 Introduction

## 2.1.1. Learning Goals

- **Understand the basics of variables, expressions, and statements in Python.**  
  Gain a foundational understanding of how variables store values, how expressions combine values and operators, and how statements execute actions in Python.

- **Differentiate between data types and apply type conversions.**  
  Recognize different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Learn how to convert between types using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()`.

- **Properly name variables following Python conventions.**  
  Follow best practices for naming variables, including using descriptive names, adhering to snake_case, and avoiding reserved keywords.

- **Grasp the flow of execution through function calls and expressions.**  
  Understand how Python executes code sequentially, how function calls alter the flow of execution, and how expressions are evaluated.

- **Update and reassign variables effectively.**  
  Learn how to modify variable values by reassignment and understand how operations like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` update variables dynamically.

## 2.1.2. Objectives

- **Identify values and their data types.**  
  Recognize and distinguish between different types of values, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

- **Perform operations using different operators.**  
  Apply arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators to manipulate data effectively.

- **Understand function calls and their role in expressions.**  
  Learn how function calls work, their syntax, and how they contribute to evaluating expressions in Python.

- **Explore Python's order of operations.**  
  Study the precedence and associativity rules that determine how expressions are evaluated in Python.

- **Practice variable reassignment and updating.**  
  Modify and update variable values dynamically using different assignment operations.

## 2.2. Values and Data Types

### 1. Research:

- **What is a value in Python?**  
  A value in Python is a fundamental unit of data that a program manipulates. It can be a number, text, or other data types.

- **Identify different data types in Python:**  
  Python has various data types, including:
  - **Integers (`int`)** – Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
  - **Floats (`float`)** – Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`).
  - **Strings (`str`)** – Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., `'hello'`, `"Python"`).
  - **Booleans (`bool`)** – Represents `True` or `False` values.

### 2. Fun Fact:

- **Python is dynamically typed** – You don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. The type is assigned at runtime based on the value stored.
